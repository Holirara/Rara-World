# Why You Can Never Dream Too Big #

### Dear readers,###

For years, I have always been chasing my dreams. In my head I always say, “Oh i wish I could do this,” or, “how cool would it be if I could do that?!” Yet, most of the time, I am too afraid to really put my mind to it. We all use those excuses, ‘I don’t have enough money’ or ‘I don’t have the time’, but when it comes down to it, what is it we are actually shying away from? Boundaries others have set for us? Or boundaries we have set ourselves? 
 
I’ll give you an example. 
 
Family members are always trying to protect you, so when they say “Don’t do that, it’s ridiculous” or “Don’t be stupid, you can’t do that!” what they are really saying is, “You might hurt yourself,” or “I don’t want you to be upset if you fail”. What I learnt in the last couple of months, is those boundaries they have set up are only there to protect you. Many people say it, don’t dream too big. But… why not? Well I’m about to tell you why we should break those boundaries. Either way, the only ones really making those boundaries are ourselves. 
 
My brother once said to me I was stupid for trying to apply for a job in Germany.
“How will you be able to get a job or work experience in Germany when you haven’t even had a proper job  in England yet? You need to stick to trying to find a job in London.”
At first, I was upset, angry even, at the fact that my brother had little belief in me. But you know what? He only said that because he was worried I was setting myself up for failure. 
However, dreaming big can be accounted for when it is well planned. Here’s what I had done:
I had already met a man in Kuala Lumpur who had my dream job. I emailed him nonstop asking him for work experience, then I emailed his boss, and eventually, what happened? I got the placement. And I am DEAD excited to actually complete it now, too! (I start in September).
I turned the unrealistic, into the realistic. And I achieved my goal.
 
So there you go, you can **NEVER** dream too big.
