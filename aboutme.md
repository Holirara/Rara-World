# About MeÂ 

##_My little life of Ra...

Hey! Want to know a little bit more about me? 
Well... I was born in Oxford, grew up in a little village in the middle of nowhere, in Wiltshire, and then became an English Literature with Creative Writing student studying at Newcastle University, and now I am a freelance writer and editor!
 
Birthday: **5th December**

Fave day of the week: **Friday**

(it just feels like a good day when it's nearly the end the week!)
 
**Loves:** Blueberries (!), playing the piano, going to the gym, socialising with friends, drinking tea, shopping for new clothes, relaxing in the sun, cuddling up with Bruno, my wonderful family, writing stories and poetry, meeting new people, getting caught in the rain, and travelling to far away places!
 
**Hates:** Soggy potatoes, waking up on Monday and thinking it's still the weekend (nightmare!), being under-the-weather, being bored, unwashed dishes and really gory horror films.
