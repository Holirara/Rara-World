# How To Conquer Your Fears in Three Days #

### Dear readers,
 
The most reckless thing I have ever done, was in Vietnam, in Phong Nha. With the help of a friend, I taught myself to ride a motorcycle. I remember the first time I sat on it, and turned the engine on, and then revved up the engine… a little too much. I flew on the bike into the parking lot to the right with gravel-stone floor, and just about managed to take the weight of the bike with one foot out! The hot metal leant against me, but I had managed my first ten seconds to come off unscathed, although feeling as if I had nearly killed myself. Actually, believe it or not, I was terrified. 

I knew how reckless it was. Just 2 weeks before, I had met American man in Hong Kong, who not long after emailed me to tell me that he had nearly lost his arm in a motorbike accident whilst riding the Hai Van Pass, a route across Vietnam. His holiday was cut short and he had flown back to America where he waited in hospital to get surgery. He was lucky to be alive. 

Yet, for some insane reason, I didn’t want to give up. 

Ten minutes later, and I got the hang of it. 

Let me tell you, the first few minutes riding that motorcycle, were undoubtedly both the most sensational and equally terrifying few minutes of my life so far. Adrenaline kicked in, but mostly because my heart was pounding. I was relieved but also buzzing when I got off the motorcycle. 

On my way back, I pushed myself to drive that little bit faster, and faster, and then a bit faster than that, until a lorry was coming in the other direction and a herd of cows decided to jump out into the middle of my road. It was speed up or crash, so I narrowly missed a combination of cow and lorry by the skin of my teeth. 
 
Three days later, I spent 9 hours on the motorcycle from Hue to Hoi An, and through the Hai Van Pass. Despite having just found out I had graduated with a 2:1 from University, the sense of achievement I felt from doing this journey was immense. It was a week of personal achievements for me, and I was so proud of myself, however reckless I had been. 
 
I had done something I never thought I could do. But I had done it, without a scratch on my body.
A Vietnamese man I rode pass about 3 hours in was less fortunate. He had had an accident and many locals were there trying to sort out his blooded head and leg. His helmet eye-shield was hanging by a chip of plastic. It was a terrible sight. I was travelling through the Hai Van Pass with a French-Canadian girl I had met the day before, called Frederique. We stopped to check he was okay, but an ambulance had already been called. 

When we arrived in Hoi An, having taken a rather long route, it was nighttime. 

Neither of us had fallen off our bikes throughout the whole nine hours.
Before this, I had been too scared to drive a car on the motorway, despite having passed three years ago. After a car crash I had two years ago, I have not been confident enough to make a car journey longer than one hour. It has taken me three years of driving a car to ride one hour. 

It took me three days of driving a motorcycle to do nine.
 
However reckless, this is one of the greatest achievements I feel I have done, and actually, it has made me realise, I can do anything I want to. It has given me the confidence to believe in myself; you can do whatever you put your mind to. 
 
**Never give up.**
